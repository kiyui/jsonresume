She first started as a Frontend then she moved to our team as the Backend/DevOps to build our new product: Piktostory.  She is the key pillar to the success of Piktostory which she single-handedly set up and managed the entire backend and infrastructure, while also contributing to the frontend on cross-functional projects. Specifically, She designed and coded the entire Firebase/Nodejs backend, created an automated and scalable deployment with Kubernetes on GCP, helped set up Webpack for frontend, developed application solutions involving usage of NLP, and also created our backend video renderer, just to name a few.  I’ve always been grateful to work with her, of which she is a great member for technical discussion, she has helped guide numerous technical projects. She also strives to deliver high-quality work autonomously and that has been the model of our engineers. I strongly recommend her to any team that is looking for a great, versatile DevOps engineer."
